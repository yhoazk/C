## Turn off the echo in Linux terminal

Simply add the following line to your script:

stty -echo

and you are done. The stty output will go offline. Letâ€™s see an example:
```sh
#!/bin/bash
echo Hello
stty -echo
# do what ever you want to do
echo 'I slept with your girlfriend'
stty echo
echo Bye
exit 0;
```
